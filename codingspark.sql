In American English, the shares are commonly known as \"stocks\". A single share of the stock represents fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to the total number of shares. This typically entitles the stockholder to that fraction of the company\'s earnings, proceeds from liquidation of assets (after discharge of all senior claims such as secured and unsecured debt), or voting power, often dividing these up in proportion to the amount of money each stockholder has invested. Not all stock is necessarily equal, as certain classes of stock may be issued for example without voting rights, with enhanced voting rights, or with a certain priority to receive profits or liquidation proceeds before or after other classes of shareholders.', 'about-bg.jpg', '2019-10-13 20:49:47'),

The Blockchain is a novel disruptive technology based on cryptography. It has been known of the work of \r\nNakamoto in 2008 who showed how this technology can become the core component to support transactions of the digital currency (bitcoin) . With the introduction of Blockchain, many fields such as finance, accounting, and real estate will receive a positive impact using the benefits of this technology. One area in which blockchain technology could play a vital role is real estate and smart cities.\r\n', '', '2019-10-14 23:02:02'),

It was introduced with Bitcoin to solve the double-spending problem. As a result of how the nodes on the Bitcoin network (the so-called miners) append validated, mutually agreed-upon transactions to it, the Bitcoin blockchain houses the authoritative ledger of transactions that establishes who owns what.', '', '2019-10-14 23:03:37'),
(5, 'Smart Contract', 'Concept of Smart contract in Blockchain', 'fifth-post', 'The history of smart contracts can be traced back to the 1990s when Wei Dai, a computer engineer created a post on anonymous credits, which described an anonymous loan scheme with redeemable bonds and lump-sum taxes to be collected at maturity [1]. Szabo et al. [93] later discussed the potential form of smart contracts and proposed to use cryptographic mechanisms to enhance security. Nowadays, with the development of blockchain technology, smart contracts are being constructed as computer programs running on blockchain nodes and can be issued among untrusted, anonymous parties without the involvement of any third party. The first successful implementation of a blockchain-based smart contract was Bitcoin Script,  a purposely not-turing-complete language with a set of simple, pre-defined commands.', '', '2019-10-14 23:06:14'),

It will open up the gates for potential investors from across the world to try their hand in real-estate investment. If executed properly, then this can be hugely beneficial for the crypto-space as well, because it will increase the real-life utility of tokens. The scary part is that we have just scratched the surface of what could be possible via the marriage of blockchain and real-estate.
